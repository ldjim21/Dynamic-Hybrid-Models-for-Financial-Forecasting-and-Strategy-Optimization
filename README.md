# Dynamic-Hybrid-Models-for-Financial-Forecasting-and-Strategy-Optimization

This repository contains the code and data used in the research project “Dynamic Hybrid Models for Financial Forecasting and Strategy Optimization”.
The study explores hybrid forecasting frameworks that combine traditional econometric models (ARIMA, ARFIMA) with modern machine learning and deep learning techniques (SVM, XGBoost, LSTM).
The objective is to evaluate how integrating linear and nonlinear modeling components can enhance forecasting accuracy and trading performance in financial markets.
